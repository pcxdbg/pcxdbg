A cross-platform debugger front-end written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and embedded within an [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) host.

## Development

The only requirement to build the application is to have Node.js installed. Once that is done, install all dependencies with:

```npm i```

Then an Electron host with live reload can be started using:

```npm run start```
